        <h2>What is Time?</h2>
        <p>
          Time is the continuous sequence of events that occur from the past to the present and into the future. It is a dimension in which events occur in a perceived sequence, and a measure of change.

        <h2>Scientific Context</h2>
        <p>
          In physics, time is considered one of the fundamental quantities and is often intertwined with space to form space-time. It is used to describe events and their duration.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, Einstein's theory of relativity redefined time as relative rather than absolute, demonstrating its flexibility under extreme conditions.

        <h2>Philosophical Perspectives</h2>
        <p>
          Philosophers have long debated the nature of time. Is it a real entity or a construct of human perception? Time is often seen as a river, flowing forward relentlessly, or as a canvas, on which events are painted.
